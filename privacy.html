            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Khiladi Zone operates its portal in India, offering online E-sports and casual games through the web portal KhiladiZone.com and mobile application(s) available on our official website (collectively referred to as the “portal”). Khiladi Zone is a product referred to herein as “Khiladi Zone” or “we” or “us” or “our.”
                <br><br>Khiladi Zone is considered a “game of skill.” The game of skills can be defined as a game wherein the skills of the individuals participating in any online e-sports gaming play a dominant role rather than the mere luck of the individuals.
                <br><br>Khiladi Zone respects the privacy of its users and is committed to protecting it in all respects. To offer an enriching and holistic internet experience to its users, Khiladi Zone offers a vast repository of amusement facilities. Kindly take time to read the 'About Us' section to learn more about Khiladi Zone. Most of the amusement facilities are offered for free, but you may need to register to participate in Khiladi Zone online games. The information about the user is collected by Khiladi Zone as (i) information supplied by users and (ii) information automatically tracked during the user's navigation on Khiladi Zone.
                <br><br>Before you submit any information to the portal, please read this privacy policy for an explanation of how we will treat your personal information. By using any part of the portal, you consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your personal information for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy and to the collection, processing, and maintenance of this information. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not use the portal. Your use of any part of the portal indicates your acceptance of this privacy policy and the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information by this privacy policy. While you have the option not to provide us with certain information or withdraw consent to collect certain information, kindly note that in such an event, you may not be able to take full advantage of the entire scope of features and services offered to you, and we reserve the right not to provide you with our services.

            <h2>Purpose and Usage</h2>
            <p>
                To utilize certain services on the portal, users are required to provide specific information during the registration process. This information includes:

                <br>2.Name
                <br>3.Email address
                <br>4.Date of birth

                <br><br>Furthermore, to grant you access to the features offered through the portal, verify your identity, and safeguard your account, we may request your permission to capture and record device-related information, operating system details, network specifics, and location data. Additionally, we may seek your consent to gather information regarding the apps installed on your device. This allows us to enhance our services and improve your overall experience on the portal. In certain cases, you may also be required to provide additional information, such as your Permanent Account Number (PAN).
                <br><br>In specific instances, we may collect sensitive personal information (SPI) from you on the portal. SPI refers to personal information that pertains to your financial details, such as the payment instrument or mode used for transactions. The collection of such SPI is solely to facilitate prompt and secure payments.
                <br><br>It is important to note that aside from the financial information provided during payment for services on the portal, Khiladi Zone does not collect any other SPI while delivering the services. Any SPI collected by Khiladi Zone will not be disclosed to any third-party service providers without your explicit consent, except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy or as required by law. This condition does not apply to publicly available information, including SPI related to you on the portal.
                <br><br>We collect and utilize personal information (i.e., information that can be used to identify you and is not publicly available) to operate, provide, develop, and enhance the services we offer. This includes keeping you informed about our offerings, as well as the products and services provided by our affiliates and group entities. Additionally, we may share this information with our affiliates and group entities, who may contact you regarding their products and services.
                <br><br>While using the services, users may invite other existing users or new users (referred to as "Invited Users") to participate in the services through various social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. The information provided for this purpose may be used to contact and invite the Invited Users to register with Khiladi Zone and participate in the relevant game. The participation of Invited Users in any game is subject to the terms outlined in this privacy policy and the Terms and Conditions for using the portal. By inviting others, you confirm that the Invited Users have consented to and agreed with the disclosure of their information to us, our affiliates, and/or our group entities. Additionally, you may choose to invite your friends by synchronizing your phonebook and directly inviting them from the portal to play the game and utilize the services.
                <br><br>All the required information is specific to the type of game or services the user wishes to participate in or access. It will be utilized solely to provide the requested services and ensure a seamless user experience.

This sharing is intended to enable Khiladi Zone’s affiliates and group entities to contact you regarding the products and services they offer.

Any affiliate, group entity, or third-party service provider with whom the information is shared will be required to maintain the same standards as Khiladi Zone in terms of information security to the best of their abilities.
                <br><br>By using the portal, you explicitly agree and grant consent to the collection, use, and storage of your information by Khiladi Zone. Khiladi Zone reserves the right to share, disclose, and transfer the information collected, including personal information, with its affiliates and group entities.

            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                <br><br>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the portal for our users, we use "cookies" or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's interests using the identified computer. Unless the user voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration), Khiladi Zone has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the user's hard drive. Khiladi Zone advertisers may also assign their cookies to the user's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Khiladi Zone does not control.
                <br><br>Khiladi Zone web servers automatically collect limited information about a user's computer's connection to the internet, including the user's IP address, when the user visits the portal. (The user's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Khiladi Zone uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its portal to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the portal, and to let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Khiladi Zone visitors come.

            <h2>Links</h2>
            <p>
                Khiladi Zone also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Khiladi Zone's control. Once the User leaves Khiladi Zone servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's browser), the use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Khiladi Zone's own. If the user can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the user may contact the site directly for more information. Khiladi Zone is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

            <h2>Security Procedures</h2>
            <p>
                <br><br>All information gathered on Khiladi Zone has been securely stored within Khiladi Zone-controlled databases. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to such servers is password-protected and strictly limited based on a need-to-know basis. However, we understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet. Further, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with internet access. By using the portal, you understand and agree that your information may be used in or transferred to countries other than India.
                <br><br>Khiladi Zone believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium. We may periodically review and change our privacy policy to incorporate future changes as deemed appropriate, without any notice to you. Our use of any information we gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page, so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, how we store it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.

                <br><br>There are deceptive emails, websites, blogs, and other online communications circulating on the internet that falsely claim to be associated with or from Khiladi Zone. These deceptive communications may feature our logo, photos, links, content, or other information.

We want to clarify that these deceptive communications and their accompanying materials are in no way associated with Khiladi Zone. To ensure your safety, we strongly advise against responding to such deceptive communications. Please be aware that we will not be held responsible for any loss, damage, or harm that you may experience as a result of relying on or acting upon such deceptive communications.
                <br><br>Please note that unless it is necessary for verification purposes as outlined in the Terms and Conditions, we and our employees will not contact you to request your sensitive personal information (SPI).

            <p>
                <br><br>Users have the right to request the deletion of their user accounts and personal information from Khiladi Zone. To initiate this process, users can send a written request via email to support@khiladizone.com.

                <br>-Alternatively, temporary deactivation prevents login access to the Portal but allows users to reactivate their accounts along with all associated data.
                <br>-If a user chooses to permanently deactivate their account, they will lose access to the Portal and its services, including any user data and personal information linked to their account.
                <br><br>When a data deletion request is made, we follow a secure deletion process to ensure that the data is completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We take precautions to protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. However, please note that there may be slight delays between the deletion request and the removal of data from both our active systems and backup systems.
