                Khiladi Zone, the operator of this online gaming website, https://www.khiladizone.com/ (“Website”, including
                the mobile application), is committed to promoting responsible gaming and preventing excessive gaming. This
                Responsible Gaming Policy outlines the Company’s commitments and your responsibilities to encourage
                responsible gaming practices and reduce the negative impacts of excessive gaming. Games may involve
                financial risk and can be addictive. Please play responsibly and at your own risk.

            <p>
            If you choose to play on our Website, here are some general guidelines to make your playing experience safer
            and help avoid excessive gaming:

            Add money to the Khiladi Zone Wallet only with funds you can afford to spend.
            Never add money to the Khiladi Zone Wallet with funds needed for essential items such as food, rent, bills,
            or tuition.
            Plan your purchases and the time you will spend playing on the Website in advance, and stick to that limit,
            regardless of your performance.
            Avoid playing when you are upset, tired, or depressed, as it is difficult to make good decisions when
            feeling down.
            Do not neglect personal and other important tasks in order to play. Complete all essential tasks so you can
            play with a clear and calm mind.
            Balance your gameplay duration with other activities. Engage in other forms of entertainment to ensure
            gaming does not become too dominant in your life.
            Do not borrow money to make purchases on the Website.
            Avoid using all the funds in the Khiladi Zone Wallet in a single game or session.
            Take regular time-outs and breaks.
            Only participate in games that match your skill level and financial capabilities. Avoid being tempted to
            join high-stakes tables even if you are winning consistently.

            <h2>Age Exclusion</h2>
<br>
            Any underage player who provides false or inaccurate information about their age may forfeit all winnings
            and face criminal prosecution.

            Every person signing up for a new account must check a box indicating that they are at least 18 years of
            age, ensuring that we do not accept players under 18.
            When a player creates an account with us, they have the option to provide their name, address, and birth
            date to maintain their user profile on the Website.
            We never target underage players with our marketing and advertising. It is not good business practice nor
            consistent with our personal and corporate values to attract underage players.
            We self-regulate all Online Games of Skill within the territory of the Republic of India.

            We may notify users if their accrued spending exceeds a certain limit. Users may be notified to take an
            optional break if their game sessions are long. If a user’s session exceeds a certain time, the Company may
            mandate a non-negotiable break, during which the user may not use the Website.
